      &nbsp;&nbsp; It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena…”

    <div class="introduction">
      Too often, fear of failure or judgment keeps us on the sidelines. We watch, we critique, we imagine how things could be done, but we hesitate to act. For me, the arena has always been real, demanding, and sometimes unforgiving. From losing my father at sixteen to navigating financial hardship, every choice required stepping into uncertainty. There were moments when survival alone seemed impossible, yet stepping into those challenges shaped the person I am today.

      <h2>Meaning</h2>
      <p>
        The arena has taken many forms in my life. As a child, it was designing costumes for school theatre productions, piecing together materials and imagination to bring stories to life. Later, it was surviving without formal education, mastering trades like woodworking and tailoring to support myself, and ultimately returning to academics through coding and computer science. Every challenge was a lesson in creativity, resilience, and the courage to continue despite fear or doubt. The arena is where I discovered that pursuing what truly matters [ideas, solutions, impact] is far more rewarding than merely avoiding risk.

      <h2>Value</h2>
      <p>
        Motivation, I’ve learned, doesn’t come from avoiding difficulty—it comes from daring to act in spite of it. From founding technical communities at university to mentoring dozens of students, and from volunteering at healthcare research centers to pursuing graduate research, I have faced uncertainty, systemic challenges, and skepticism. Each step required persistence, integrity, and focus. The applause of critics is fleeting, but the growth and impact that come from acting courageously are lasting. Stepping into the arena may not guarantee victory, but it guarantees transformation.

      <h2>Focus</h2>
      <p>
        Today, the arena is where my vision and purpose converge: building computational tools to improve healthcare outcomes, especially for women in resource-limited settings. Each experiment, each project, and each research question is an opportunity to act, to learn, and to persevere. While success is never certain, the act of daring itself defines progress and builds the capacity to make meaningful contributions.
